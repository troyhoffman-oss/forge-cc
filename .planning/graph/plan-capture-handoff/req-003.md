## Context
When plan loads a captured project, it should carry over ALL context — not just the project name. The captured issues represent the user's initial thinking and should seed the requirement refinement process. After plan creates proper requirement graph issues, the rough capture issues are archived.

## Technical Approach

### Loading context (modify Step 2 in forge-plan.md):
1. After project selection in Step 0, call `getProjectDetails(projectId)` for full description
2. Call `getProjectIssues(projectId)` to load all captured issues
3. Use project description as pre-populated context for interview (skip "what problem does this solve?")
4. Present captured issues as draft vertical slices in the "converge on requirements" phase
5. Interview refines these drafts — user can split, merge, rewrite, or discard them

### Archiving issues (modify Step 6 in forge-plan.md):
1. After creating new requirement graph issues in Linear, archive original capture issues
2. Add `archiveIssues(issueIds: string[])` method to `ForgeLinearClient`
3. Transition each original capture issue to "Cancelled" state before archiving

### Interview flow adjustment:
- Skip "What problem does this project solve?" — use project description
- Skip "What are the top 3 goals?" — derive from project description
- Still ask about scope exclusions, acceptance criteria, and integration points
- Present captured issues and ask: "Here are the issues from capture. Which should become requirements? Any to merge, split, or drop?"

## Interview Notes
- User said: "grab everything but needs to overwrite and replace as the interview necessitates"
- User chose "Archive and replace" for issue lifecycle
- Downstream steps (sizing, quiz, graph generation, Linear sync) remain unchanged
