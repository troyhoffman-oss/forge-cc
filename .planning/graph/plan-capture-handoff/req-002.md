acceptance:
  - "Running /forge:plan lists all captured Linear projects (Backlog status) with name and description snippet"
  - "User selects a project from the list via AskUserQuestion"
  - "If no captured projects exist, falls back to standalone interview (current from-scratch behavior)"
  - "Selected project's ID is passed to subsequent interview steps"

## Context
Currently `/forge:plan` Step 0 checks for `--from-capture` flag and otherwise asks "what are you building?" The user wants the default to be listing captured projects — the from-scratch interview is the fallback, not the primary path.

## Technical Approach
Rewrite Step 0 in `skills/forge-plan.md`:

1. Load `.forge.json` to get `linearTeam`
2. Call `listProjectsByStatus(teamId, 'backlog')` to get captured projects
3. If projects found: present them via `AskUserQuestion` with project names and description snippets
4. If no projects found: print "No captured projects found. Starting from scratch." and proceed to current Step 2 interview
5. Remove the `--from-capture` flag documentation — it's no longer needed since the picker is the default

The `--from-capture <slug>` flag can be kept as an undocumented shortcut but the skill instructions should not mention it prominently.

## Interview Notes
- User explicitly said: "I basically just don't want you asking about scoping new projects and to just do the same stuff but look for existing projects and interviewing about them"
- No standalone flag — if no projects, fall back silently
- No need for special CLI flags or modes
