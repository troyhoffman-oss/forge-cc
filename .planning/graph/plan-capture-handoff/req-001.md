  - "getProjectIssues(projectId) returns all issues for a project with title, description, and state"
---

## Context
The Linear client currently has `listProjects(teamId)` which returns `{ id, name, state }` but no description. There's no method to fetch a single project's full details or its issues. Plan needs both of these to load capture context.

## Technical Approach
Add three methods to `ForgeLinearClient` in `src/linear/client.ts`:

1. **`getProjectDetails(projectId)`** — Uses `this.client.project(id)` (already used internally) but exposes it publicly. Returns `{ id, name, description, statusCategory }`.

2. **`listProjectsByStatus(teamId, statusCategory)`** — Enhances the existing `listProjects` pattern with a status filter and includes the description field. Used by plan's project picker.

3. **`getProjectIssues(projectId)`** — Fetches all issues belonging to a project. Returns `{ id, title, description, state }[]`. Used to load captured issues as draft requirements.

All methods should follow the existing `LinearResult<T>` pattern used throughout the client.

## Interview Notes
- User confirmed plan needs to load everything capture created (project + issues)
- Plan will archive original capture issues after creating requirement graph
- Linear client is the only touchpoint for API changes
