title: "Capture skill creates projects at Backlog"
group: Capture Lifecycle
dependsOn: []
files:
  creates: []
  modifies:
    - skills/forge-capture.md
acceptance:
  - "Capture skill creates new Linear projects with status category 'backlog' instead of 'planned'"
  - "The Linear State Reference table at the bottom of the skill shows Project → Backlog"
  - "Optional issues created by capture are also at Backlog state"
---

## Context
The capture skill currently creates projects at "Planned" state, but capture is just brain-dumping ideas — they haven't been planned yet. "Backlog" is the correct initial state. The plan skill then transitions to "Planned" when the project is actually planned.

## Technical Approach
1. Update `skills/forge-capture.md`:
   - Change the instruction for project creation to use the "Backlog" state instead of "Planned"
   - Update the Linear State Reference table at the bottom to show `Project → Backlog` and `Issue → Backlog`
   - Change the final note from "Do NOT set any item to 'Backlog'" to use Backlog as the default

2. This gives the correct state flow:
   - Capture → Backlog (just an idea)
   - Plan → Planned (requirements defined)
   - Build → In Progress (work started, via hooks)
   - Ship → In Review (PR created, via hooks)
   - Merge → Completed (PR merged, via hooks + Linear native)

## Interview Notes
- Small change but fixes the front half of the lifecycle
- The user explicitly wanted Backlog for capture during our discussion
