  - "Plan skill creates a Linear milestone for each group in the requirement graph"
  - "Each milestone's linearMilestoneId is stored in the group's entry in _index.yaml"
  - "Each issue created by the plan skill is assigned to its group's milestone via projectMilestoneId"
  - "Milestone progress auto-calculates in Linear based on child issue completion"

## Context
The plan skill creates Linear issues (one per requirement) but never creates milestones for groups. The graph schema already supports `linearMilestoneId` on `GroupDef` and the CLI has `forge linear create-milestone`. The plan skill just needs to connect the dots.

## Technical Approach
Update `skills/forge-plan.md` Step 6 (Linear Sync) to:

1. After creating the Linear project, create milestones:
   ```
   For each group in the graph:
     npx forge linear create-milestone --project {projectId} --name "{group name}"
     Store returned milestoneId in _index.yaml group entry as linearMilestoneId
   ```

2. When creating issues, include the milestone:
   ```
   For each requirement:
     Create issue with projectMilestoneId = group's linearMilestoneId
   ```

3. Write the updated index with milestone IDs via `writeIndex()`

## Interview Notes
- Linear milestones have no status field — progress auto-calculates from child issues
- The `create-milestone` CLI command already exists
- The `createIssue` API already accepts `projectMilestoneId`
- This is purely a skill instruction change — plan already reliably creates issues, this adds milestone creation to the same flow
