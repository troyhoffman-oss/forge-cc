## Projects
| Project | Status | Milestones |
|---------|--------|------------|
| forge-mcp (research) | Active — ready for `/flow:go` | 3 milestones |

---

## forge-mcp (Research Phase)
**Goal:** Design the optimal e2e autonomous dev workflow for Troy + Matt using Claude Code, Flow, Linear, and verification tooling. Produce RECOMMENDATION.md as input for the build PRD.

| Milestone | Name | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Parallel Deep Research — 5 agents (flow audit, OAI patterns, Linear lifecycle, verification, msig patterns) | Pending |
| 2 | Cross-Cutting Analysis — 3 agents (architecture options, multi-dev gaps, ideal state vision) | Pending |
| 3 | Synthesis — 1 agent produces RECOMMENDATION.md | Pending |

**After research:** Run `/flow:spec` again to produce the build PRD from RECOMMENDATION.md.
